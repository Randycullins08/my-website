              Iâ€™m a music and sound producer operating from the great state of
              Montana. I have a background in engineering, mixing, and mastering
              bands from the Midwest, and Pacific Northwest. I have a passion
              for helping bands and artists realize their goals and the sounds
              they are trying to capture.
